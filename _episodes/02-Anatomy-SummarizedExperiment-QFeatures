# Anatomy of a SummarizedExperiment object

Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics data can be representated as a 
matrix of quantitative values for features (PSMs, peptides, proteins) arranged 
along the rows, measured for a set of samples, arranged along the columns.
`SummarizedExperiment` class [@SE] handle this kind of tabular data.

These are the component pieces of the `SummarizedExperiment` for data representation.

# Anatomy of a QFeatures object

The `QFeatures` package [@Gatto:2020] is based on the `SummarizedExperiment` and `MultiAssayExperiment` classes and provides infrastructure to manage and analyse quantitative features from mass spectrometry experiments. It follows a hierarchical structure: *spectra* compose  *peptides* which in turn compose *proteins*. The main advantage of this structure is that is very easy to  navigate across spectra, peptide and protein quantitative data.
