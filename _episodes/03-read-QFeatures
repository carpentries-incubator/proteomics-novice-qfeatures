## Read peptide file into QFeatures 

~~~
library("QFeatures")
cptac <- readQFeatures(f, ecol = i, sep = "\t", name = "peptides", fnames = "Sequence")
~~~
{:.language-r}


> ## Exercise
>
> Use the `colData` function to see description of each sample from `cptac`

## Encode the experimental design in QFeatures

We can update the sample (column) annotations to encode the two
groups, 6A and 6B, and the original sample numbers.

~~~
ptac$group <- rep(c("6A", "6B"), each = 3)
cptac$sample <- rep(7:9, 2)
colData(cptac)
~~~
{:.language-r}


## Get metadata information of QFeatures 

We can get metadata information of QFeatures

~~~
rowData(cptac)
~~~
{:.language-r}


We can use the `assay` function to get a matrix-like `cptac`

~~~
library("magrittr")
assay(cptac) %>% head(2)
~~~
{:.language-r}
