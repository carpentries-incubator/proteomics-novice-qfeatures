Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics data can be representated as a matrix of quantitative values for features (PSMs, peptides, proteins) arranged along the rows, measured for a set of samples, arranged along the columns. The SummarizedExperiment and MultiAssayExperiment classes (Morgan et al. 2020) can handle such data. QFeatures is derived from MultiAssayExperiment.
