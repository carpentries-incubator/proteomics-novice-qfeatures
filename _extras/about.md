**Lesson Title: An Introduction to Proteomics data analysis with QFeatures**

## Target audience

The main audience of this carpentry lesson is researches that are familiar with proteomics data analysis but have little to no experience with QFeatures, a Bioconductore package for analysing quantitative features for mass spectrometry data. In addition, we expect them to be familiar with R. We do not expect them to be familiar with `SummarizedExperiment` objects, and aim that the learners will learn about them in this tutorial.

### Learner Profiles

#### Chloe from proteomics facility




### Notes
- They may not see why they could benefict from using these structures.
- Probably they are intimidated to use Bioconductor objects.
- They have no idea how step the learning curve will be.
- Want to learn using a real life example.

#### Required Pre-Knowledge

- **R** – Previous programming experience in R is required 
- **Basic Proteomics data analysis is required** – 

## Learning objectives

> ## Overview
> After following this lesson, learners will be able to:
>  
> - Build `QFeatures` data structure
> - Extract components of a `QFeatures` data structure
> - Use functions supported by `QFeatures` package to process quantitative proteomics data


The following offers more details to each learning objective based on Bloom's Taxonomy. For hints on how to use this approach, see [lesson 15 of the instructor training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/15-lesson-study/index.html)
